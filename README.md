ZFiler+ V1.2 Released!

What does this app do?

Well, this is the first version of the app, and it doesn't offer much at the moment. Let me explain.

The app can run or search any path that the user wants to explore. For example, it can read and write to most .plist files. In this initial version, the app is limited to these features. Looking ahead to upcoming updates, the app will gain the ability to:

• Create/Import any file, supporting all file formats (except for mp4, mp3, or photo formats).
• Edit/Delete any file/folder according to user preferences.
• Unzip and zip iPA files (and other files).

That's all for the upcoming update. I'm uncertain about the release date due to time constraints, but thanks for visiting my app!
